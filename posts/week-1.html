        <h2>An Exciting New Year</h2>
        <p>The main project this week was my work on the Deep Focus Assistant with Claude Sonnet 3.5. Attempted a brief foray into DeepSeek V3 for troubleshooting, but frequent hallucinations forced me to abandon the idea entirely. Finally stopped editing the source code for the Deep Focus Assistant from the Command Prompt terminal and imported the folder into VSCode after I got my PC working again. I run into errors quite often as I attempt to work on it, but we'll keep progressing. Still, it is pretty depressing that I haven't been able to implement even the Pomodoro timer in the first week. Guess I'll have to do a hell of a lot more trouble-shooting.

Second side project of the week was me attempting to (rather successfully, I might add) create a blog on GitHub pages. Took a surprising amount of work and gave me a first hand introduction to the proper method of handling a repository, pull requests, cloning a repository, making changes and pushing it right back, what HTML and CSS look like and how to work on them. I'm really grateful to the guy who gave me the inspiration on the blog (https://ivanstudyblog.github.io/day-1/). Probably kick-started my future a bit there.

Lastly, the actual machine learning. Didn't do much but watch the 3Blue1Brown series on Deep Learning. Trying to think of some good starter projects that'll familiarise me with the latest tools and the logic of the whole thing. Also, I do regret saying that I didn't see any real value in karpathy's blog. Well, maybe there wasn't, but the video series is very, very impressive. I'll be watching it, along with reading the Mathematics of Machine Learning (textbook) as part of my main curriculum starting next week.

I do say next week pretty casually. But it really isn't, a whole lot of stuff goes down. My A-Level results come out, I need a lawyer to certify them and then I just pray to God everything goes down well with the universities that I've applied too. So yeah, that's pretty much it for Week 1! </p>
